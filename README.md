## ⚡ Fun Fact
Did you know?
- The world’s first FPS game, "Wolfenstein 3D," was released in 1992 and set the standard for the genre!
- In some games, bullets are actually invisible "hit-scan" rays, not physical objects flying through space.
- The term “rocket jump” (using an explosion to propel yourself) became popular in classic shooters and is now a beloved game mechanic.
- Some games, like "Superhot," make time move only when the player moves, turning gun battles into strategic puzzles.
- GoldenEye 007 for N64 was one of the first shooters to feature “aiming down sights,” now a staple in most gun games.
